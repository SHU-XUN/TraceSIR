If so, does it show an MMSC or mmsc field with a URL? If unsure, just let me know what the APN name is and whether MMSC is filled in.\n\n5) Network technology (2G/3G/4G/5G)\n- What network type does it show (e.g., 5G, LTE, 4G, 3G, 2G, or E)?\n\n6) Messaging app permissions\n- Open your phone settings → Apps → Messaging (or the messaging app you use).\n- Check that it has permissions for Storage and SMS. Do you see both as “Allowed”?\n\n7) Optional background features\n- Is Data Saver mode ON or OFF?\n- Is Wi-Fi Calling ON or OFF?\n- Is a VPN turned ON?\n\nIf you know how, you can also try sending one picture message now and tell me exactly what error message appears.\n\nOnce you share your account details and the results above, I’ll check your line status and guide you step-by-step to restore MMS.",

Reseating the SIM is safe and won’t delete any photos, contacts, apps, or data on your phone. It simply removes and reinserts the small SIM card so the phone can recognize it.\n\nI’ll guide you slowly. If anything feels uncomfortable, stop and tell me what you see.\n\nReseat the SIM card step by step\n1) Power off your phone completely:\n   - Hold the power button and choose “Power off” or “Shut down.”\n2) Locate the SIM tray:\n   - Look along the sides of the phone for a small pinhole (usually on the top or bottom edge).\n   - If your phone is older and has a removable back, the SIM might be under the battery instead—tell me and I’ll guide you differently.\n3) Eject the tray:\n   - Straighten a small paperclip or use the SIM eject tool that came with the phone.\n   - Gently push into the pinhole until the tray pops out slightly. Then pull it out.\n4) Inspect the SIM card and tray:\n   - The SIM should be a small rectangular chip, seated snugly in the tray’s cutout.\n   - Make sure the chip faces the same way as the drawing on the tray (if shown).\n   - If the SIM looks loose, crooked, or out of place, carefully reseat it so it sits flat and fully in the cutout.\n   - If you see dust or debris, gently blow it away—don’t use liquids.\n5) Reinsert the tray:\n   - Slide the tray back in the same direction it came out, until it’s flush with the phone.\n6) Power the phone on:\n   - Turn it back on and wait 1–2 minutes.\n\nAfter it powers on:\n- Check the top of the screen. Do you see any signal bars or network letters now?\n- In Settings → Mobile Network, does the SIM status show any message or just the carrier name?\n\nIf you see an error like “SIM not detected,” “SIM card error,” or a prompt for a PIN/PUK, stop and tell me exactly what it says, and I’ll guide you.\n\nAlso, when you’re ready, please share your date of birth (YYYY-MM-DD). That lets me verify your account and enable international roaming on your line—sometimes the line needs that before it connects abroad. If needed, I can enable it for you at no cost.",
