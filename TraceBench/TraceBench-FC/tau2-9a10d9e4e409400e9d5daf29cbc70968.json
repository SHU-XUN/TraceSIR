Avoid 2G/3G only.\n- Tell me what mode you selected.\n\nStep 6: Verify APN settings (important when abroad)\n- Go to Settings > Mobile Network / Cellular > Access Point Names (APN).\n- If there is any doubt or if it looks incorrect, reset to default. If you prefer to check first, read out the APN name and MMSC URL to me.\n- If you reset it, you’ll need to reboot after this step.\n- Confirm whether you kept current settings or reset them.\n\nStep 7: Reboot the device\n- Restart your phone fully (power off and back on).\n- Once it boots back up, tell me.\n\nStep 8: Speed test\n- After reboot, run a speed test on your device using a browser-based speed test or an app.\n- Share the download speed result (e.g., Mbps) and any note like “excellent,” “good,” etc.\n\nPlease start with Step 1 and paste what you see.
