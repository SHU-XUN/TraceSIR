Please go through these and tell me what you find:\n\n1) MMS capability test:\n   - Some phones show an “MMS not available” or “Can’t send MMS” notice when attempting. Do you see any specific error in your messaging app?\n\n2) Network mode:\n   - Confirm your preferred network mode includes 3G/4G/5G. If it’s set to 2G only, switch it to a mode that includes 4G/5G.\n\n3) APN settings:\n   - Open your mobile network settings and check the APN. Look for an MMSC URL field. If it’s blank or looks incorrect, reset the APN to the carrier defaults. After resetting, you’ll need to reboot the phone.\n\n4) Wi‑Fi Calling:\n   - If Wi‑Fi Calling is turned on, try turning it OFF temporarily. Some configurations interfere with MMS while roaming.\n\n5) Messaging app permissions:\n   - Check that your messaging app has permissions for Storage and SMS. If either is denied, grant them.\n\n6) Final test:\n   - After each adjustment, try sending a picture message.\n\nPlease let me know:\n- What error/message you see when trying to send MMS now.\n- Your current network mode setting.\n- Whether the MMSC URL was missing or incorrect before/after resetting.\n- Whether Wi‑Fi Calling was on/off and if toggling it helped.\n- The permissions status for Storage and SMS in your messaging app.\n\nWith those details, I can guide you to the next fix if needed.",

Ask user to run checks that the tools simulate: can_send_mms, check_network_status (ensure not 2G), check_apn_settings (MMSC), check_wifi_calling_status (disable if ON), check_app_permissions for messaging (storage, sms). Then step through fixes: reset_apn_settings + reboot, toggle_wifi_calling OFF, grant permissions. Since tools are simulated, instruct user to perform those steps on device."
