If you’re unsure, we can reset them to defaults.\n\n6) Wi‑Fi Calling\n- Is Wi‑Fi Calling turned on? If yes, we can try turning it off temporarily, as it sometimes interferes with MMS.\n\n7) Messaging app permissions\n- Does your messaging app have permission to access storage and SMS?\n\n8) Test MMS\n- Can you try sending a small photo now and tell me what error you see, if any?\n\nIf you’d like, I can guide you step-by-step through checking each of these.

I think I’ve found the likely cause: your data plan has a monthly limit of 15 GB, and your line is showing about 15.1 GB used. When you reach the limit, data-dependent services like picture messaging can stop working.\n\nWe can fix this in one of two ways:\n1) Refuel data for this month\n- We can add up to 2 GB at $2 per GB. Even a small 0.5 GB or 1 GB refuel would restore connectivity so you can send photos right away.\n- How much would you like to add? (Options: 0.5 GB, 1 GB, 1.5 GB, 2 GB)\n\n2) Change to a plan with more data\n- If you expect to use more than 15 GB regularly, we can switch you to a higher-data plan for future months.\n\nWhich option would you prefer? If you choose refueling, tell me the amount and I’ll process it for you.",
