Please try these steps in order and tell me what happens after each:\n\nStep 1: Turn on Mobile Data\n- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile data and toggle it ON.\n- If you can’t find it, swipe down from the top and look for a “Mobile data” toggle in the quick settings panel.\n\nStep 2: Check Airplane Mode\n- If you see an airplane icon in the status bar, Airplane Mode is ON.\n- Turn it OFF: swipe down to quick settings and tap the Airplane Mode icon.\n- After turning it OFF, wait 10–15 seconds and see if signal returns.\n\nStep 3: Reboot the device\n- Restart your phone. This can clear temporary glitches affecting the radio.\n- After reboot, check if the signal returns and whether mobile data shows as enabled.\n\nStep 4: Check the SIM\n- If you still have no signal:\n  - Power off the phone.\n  - Remove the SIM card, wait 10 seconds, then reinsert it firmly.\n  - Power the phone back on and wait for it to register on the network.\n\nStep 5: Check network mode preference\n- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network > Preferred network type.\n- Ensure it’s not set to 2G only. Set it to a mode that includes 3G/4G/5G (e.g., “4G/5G Auto” or similar).\n\nWhat to report back:\n- After Step 1: Did the mobile data toggle turn on successfully?\n- After Step 2: Did the airplane icon disappear?\n- After Step 3: Do you see signal bars again? If yes, does the network type show (5G/4G/LTE)?\n- After Step 4: Any change?\n- After Step 5: What network type is selected now?\n\nIf signal returns and mobile data is on, try sending an MMS. If it still fails, we’ll check APN settings and app permissions.\n\nIf none of these steps bring back signal, I can also look up your account using the phone number 555-123-2002, but I’ll need your date of birth for verification. Would you like me to do that after we try these steps?",
