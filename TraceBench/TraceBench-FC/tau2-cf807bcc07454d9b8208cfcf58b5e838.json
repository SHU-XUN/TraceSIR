Since I already processed the return for the two skateboards from order #W7553978, the order status is now \"return requested\" rather than \"delivered.\" \n\nUnfortunately, our system only allows one return request per order, so I cannot process the smart watch return from that same order. The smart watch will need to be returned along with the skateboards you already requested to return.\n\nHowever, I can still process the e-reader return from your other order (#W3239882). Let me do that for you now:\n\n**E-Reader Return (from Order #W3239882):**\n- E-Reader (8-inch, Wi-Fi, 8GB) - $252.06\n- Refund to your original credit card (Mastercard ending in 9375)\n\nDo you confirm that you want to proceed with returning the e-reader?

This makes sense because I already processed a return for order #W7553978 (the skateboards), and now the order status is \"return requested\" rather than \"delivered\". \n\nAccording to the policy, return or exchange can only be done once per order for delivered orders. Since I already processed a return for this order, I cannot process another return for the smart watch from the same order.\n\nI need to explain this to the user and let them know that they can only return one set of items per order. I should then proceed with the e-reader return from the other order (#W3239882) which is still in \"delivered\" status."
