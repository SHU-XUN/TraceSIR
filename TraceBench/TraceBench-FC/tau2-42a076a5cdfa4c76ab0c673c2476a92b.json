Here’s what I see:\n- Line status: Active\n- Roaming: Enabled on your account\n- Data usage this cycle: 15.1 GB used vs 15.0 GB limit\n- Cycle ends: 2025-02-28\n- Plan: Premium Plan, data refuel at $2/GB\n\nYour data is over the limit, which explains the slowdown or loss of connectivity, especially while roaming. Let’s get this fixed with two steps: restore connectivity now, then confirm you’re set up correctly for roaming in France.\n\nStep 1: Quick fixes on your device to restore connectivity\nPlease do these in order and tell me the results after each step:\n1) Check Airplane Mode\n- Open the status bar at the top of your screen and see if Airplane Mode is ON.\n- If it’s ON, turn it OFF.\n\n2) Verify Mobile Data and Roaming are ON\n- Open your phone’s network settings.\n- Make sure Mobile Data is ON.\n- Make sure Data Roaming is ON (required when abroad).\n\n3) Check Data Saver\n- In settings, look for Data Saver (often under Network & Internet).\n- If Data Saver is ON, turn it OFF.\n\n4) Check VPN\n- If you have a VPN app, turn it OFF temporarily.\n\n5) Test speed\n- Try loading a webpage or app on mobile data only (Wi-Fi OFF) and see if speed improves.\n\nStep 2: Address the data overage\nYou’re at 15.1 GB on a 15 GB plan. To get excellent speeds again right away, we can add more data. Options:\n- Refuel up to 2 GB at $2 per GB.\n- Would you like to add 1 GB or 2 GB now?\n\nIf you prefer a longer-term solution and you expect to use more data while traveling, we can also review plans with higher limits after we restore service.\n\nAdditional checks if speed is still poor after the above\n- If things are still slow, we can reset your APN settings on the phone and then reboot the device.\n- We can also check the network mode preference to make sure you’re set to 4G/5G rather than an older network.\n\nLet me know:\n- After doing Steps 1–5, does speed improve?\n- Do you want me to add 1 GB or 2 GB of data now? I’ll process it and confirm once it’s applied.",

Let’s address the most likely causes next.\n\nPlease do these steps in order and let me know the result after each:\n1) Reset APN settings\n- Go to your mobile network settings > Access Point Names (APN) and choose Reset to default or Reset APN.\n- After resetting, reboot the phone.\n\n2) After rebooting, try the speed test again (Wi-Fi OFF).\n\n3) If it still fails, check SIM status\n- In settings, look for SIM status to ensure the SIM shows as Active. If it shows “Missing” or “Locked,” let me know immediately.\n\n4) Optional quick retry: toggle Airplane Mode once\n- Turn Airplane Mode ON, wait 10 seconds, then turn it OFF, wait 30 seconds, and test again.\n\nOnce connectivity is restored, we’ll add 1 or 2 GB of data to bring you back within your limit. Let me know:\n- After Step 1+2, does the speed test work?\n- If not, what does SIM status show in Step 3?",
      "reasoning_content": "\nUser has 5G signal but speed test fails with “No Connection.” Likely causes while roaming abroad: line-level roaming not enabled (but account shows true), APN settings missing/incorrect for roaming, data overage causing throttling/block, or local SIM profile issue. Next steps: check/reset APN, reboot, test again; if still no connection, check SIM status and possibly reseat; as last resort, toggle Airplane Mode once more. Also plan to refuel 1–2 GB due to overage once connectivity is restored."
