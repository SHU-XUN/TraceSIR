Let’s pinpoint the messaging app and complete the permission check.\n\nFinding and checking the messaging app:\n- If you don’t see an app named exactly “Messaging,” look for these typical names:\n  - Messages (default on many phones)\n  - Google Messages\n  - Samsung Messages\n  - The one you use to send texts and see your conversations\n- Open Settings > Apps (or Applications), then scroll to find one of those. If multiple messaging apps exist, select the one you normally use.\n- In that app’s permissions, confirm it has:\n  - Storage (or Files and Media)\n  - SMS\n\nIf you’re still unsure which app it is, try this:\n- Open your texting app (the one with your conversation list), tap an existing chat, and look in the three-dot menu for an “About” or “App info” option. That will take you directly to the correct app page to check permissions.\n\nNext quick tests:\n- Temporarily turn Wi‑Fi OFF and try sending a small picture via MMS.\n- If it still fails, try sending an MMS with Wi‑Fi ON but keep Wi‑Fi Calling OFF.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also look at your installed app list and check permissions for the messaging app directly. Just say “Show my apps,” and I’ll guide you through identifying the right one and ensuring permissions are set.\n\nPlease let me know:\n- Which messaging app you found, and whether Storage and SMS are both granted\n- The result of the small MMS test (sent or failed)",
      "reasoning_content": "\nUser now has 5G and APN shows MMSC URL. Next steps: confirm cellular data works by browsing again (since earlier it failed before switching network mode); guide user to identify their messaging app (try default app or recent notifications), check storage/SMS permissions. If app not clear, guide via app list from device tools: run check_installed_apps and then check_app_permissions for messaging candidates. Also suggest trying a small MMS with Wi-Fi off and reboot if still failing."
