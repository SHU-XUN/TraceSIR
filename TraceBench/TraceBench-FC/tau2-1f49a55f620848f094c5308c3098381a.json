If suspended due to overdue bill, guide payment. If contract end date past, escalate for plan renewal. If active, proceed to troubleshooting: toggle mobile data, reboot, reset network settings if needed. Also, we need to ask user to reboot device; but tools provided for reboot exist in tech_support_policy as reboot_device - but that's an action that must be guided to the user, not a function I can call; there is no tool available to me for actual reboot; our tools don't include such device actions; the 'Fix Actions' list includes reboot_device but it's not in the functions set; we should not fabricate tools. So we guide user to reboot. Also consider SIM seat: already active. APN may be incorrect; we can instruct check_apn_settings then reset_apn_settings if needed; again those actions are user actions; we have check_apn_settings and reset_apn_settings as device-side actions; we don't have tools to call them; but the policy is to guide them. So guidance is fine. Also, network mode preference: if it's set to 2G/3G only and no signal, set to 4g_5g_preferred; guide. But first, retrieve customer to check line status: Do get_customer_by_phone. Then get details for lines to find the line with that phone number. If multiple, match. Then proceed. We need to make one tool call at a time. So first: get_customer_by_phone with 555-123-2002. After results, if multiple customers returned, verify with name/DOB; else proceed. Then get_details_by_id for each line or for the line ID, or look at customer's lines attribute in response. The 'get_customer_by_phone' will likely return a profile including line IDs. Then get details for each line to see status. If Suspended, follow suspension rules. If Active, guide reboot, network mode, APN, toggle roaming/airplane again. Also ask if other devices have service to rule out local outage; but we shouldn't provide knowledge outside tools; however it's within standard guidance. It's allowed; no tool needed. We should avoid subjective recommendations; it's fine. Next step: call get_customer_by_phone."
