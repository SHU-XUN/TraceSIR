Your line is active and roaming is already enabled, which is good since you’re in France.\n\nLet’s confirm connectivity and then fix MMS.\n\nFirst, how to check Wi‑Fi and cellular data on your phone\n- To check if you’re on Wi‑Fi:\n  - Look at the status bar at the top of your screen. If you see a Wi‑Fi icon, you’re connected to Wi‑Fi. If not, you’re not.\n- To check if cellular data is working:\n  - Turn Wi‑Fi off temporarily, then try loading a website or refreshing an app that uses internet. If it loads, cellular data is working.\n  - Alternatively, open your phone’s Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network (or similar) and confirm Mobile data is ON.\n\nPlease tell me:\n- Is your phone currently connected to Wi‑Fi?\n- With Wi‑Fi off, can you browse the web or use an app that needs internet?\n\nNext, let’s run a few quick checks to identify why MMS isn’t sending\nPlease perform these in order and tell me the result of each step:\n\n1) Check your status bar\n- Tell me what you see: airplane mode icon, signal strength (bars), network type (e.g., 5G/4G), and whether “Data” is shown as enabled.\n\n2) Check network status\n- This confirms whether mobile data and roaming are ON.\n\n3) Check SIM status\n- Make sure the SIM is showing as “Active.”\n\n4) Check APN settings\n- This shows the APN name and MMSC URL. The MMSC is important for MMS.\n\n5) Check Wi‑Fi Calling status\n- If it’s ON, we may need to turn it OFF temporarily while we fix MMS.\n\n6) Test MMS capability\n- Run a quick “Can send MMS” check.\n\nOptional if internet seems slow:\n7) Run a speed test with mobile data\n- This helps determine if data is too slow for MMS.\n\nIf any step shows an issue (like Data Disabled, Roaming Off, Locked SIM, or missing MMSC URL), I’ll give you the exact fix. If needed, we’ll reset the APN, adjust network mode, and ensure the messaging app has the right permissions.\n\nGo ahead and run steps 1–6 now and share what you see. I’ll guide you through any fixes.",
      "reasoning_content": "\nNow that we’ve identified the customer and confirmed the line (L1002) with roaming enabled and active, we should guide the user to verify cellular service and mobile data, and then proceed with MMS-specific checks (APN, network mode, Wi-Fi Calling, permissions). We’ll provide steps to confirm Wi-Fi and cellular data use, then have the user run diagnostic actions."
