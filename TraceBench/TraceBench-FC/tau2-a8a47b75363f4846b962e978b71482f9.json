If they go through, that tells us basic service is working. Let me know the results.\n- Wi‑Fi and Wi‑Fi Calling: Please open your phone’s settings and check:\n  - Wi‑Fi: Is it on, and which network are you connected to?\n  - Wi‑Fi Calling: Is it enabled or disabled?\n- Phone brand/model: Please tell me the make and model (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23). If you’re unsure, you can usually find this in Settings > About phone.\n\nOnce you confirm the affected line and those details, I’ll guide you step-by-step through the checks and fixes to get picture messages working again.",

MMS needs either a working cellular signal with mobile data on or a working Wi‑Fi Calling connection over Wi‑Fi. Since Wi‑Fi is off, Wi‑Fi Calling won’t help right now.\n\nLet’s proceed step by step:\n1) Quick checks you can do now:\n- Airplane Mode: If Airplane Mode is on, turn it off.\n- Mobile Data: Please turn Mobile Data on once we get a signal.\n\n2) Try a basic connectivity test:\n- With Mobile Data off, try placing a short outbound call and sending a regular SMS.\n- Tell me whether the call connects and the SMS sends. This will tell us if basic service is present.\n\n3) If you still see no signal after turning off Airplane Mode:\n- Reinsert the SIM card (or use your phone’s “reseat SIM” option if available).\n- Restart the phone after reinserting the SIM.\n\n4) After you have a signal:\n- Keep Wi‑Fi turned on (so Wi‑Fi Calling can work if needed) and Mobile Data turned on.\n- Try sending a picture message again and let me know what happens.\n\nA couple of quick questions to tailor the steps:\n- What is your phone’s make and model? (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23)\n- In your status bar, do you see any “No Signal” or “Emergency calls only” icon?\n\nIf the steps above don’t help, I can walk you through deeper checks (network mode preferences, APN settings, Wi‑Fi Calling toggle, and app permissions). But first, please:\n- Confirm Airplane Mode is off\n- Try a call and SMS\n- Let me know the phone model\n\nI’ll take it from there.",
      "reasoning_content": "\nWe need to diagnose cellular service first. The phone has no signal and mobile data disabled. Wi-Fi Calling is on. MMS requires cellular service and mobile data or Wi-Fi Calling if supported, but since no signal, Wi-Fi Calling might not help if not connected to Wi-Fi. Steps: 1) Have user check SIM status to ensure SIM active; 2) Check Airplane mode; 3) Check APN settings after getting service; 4) Ensure mobile data enabled; 5) Ensure Wi-Fi is on to support Wi-Fi Calling; 6) Try calls/SMS once service restored; 7) If Wi-Fi Calling interferes, turn it off after service works; 8) Check network mode (avoid 2G); 9) Run can_send_mms check; 10) Reset APN if needed; 11) Reboot device. Ask for phone make/model and to toggle airplane mode off if on. Ask to enable Wi-Fi and keep Wi-Fi Calling on temporarily for calling, but focus on restoring cellular service first. Also, check line suspension/resume? But we haven't fetched line details. We should get line details for L1001 (likely 555-123-2002) to see if line is active and suspension. We should also get data usage? Not needed for MMS but for data. But no signal, so likely line status. Plan: Fetch line details for 555-123-2002; but we don't have a tool to map phone number to line ID. Customer's line_ids are L1001, L1002, L1003. We could fetch details for each until match. But better to instruct diagnostics steps that user can do: check status bar, check network status, check sim status. Since policy says to use tools to guide actions; we can ask the user to run device-side diagnostics: check_status_bar, check_network_status, check_sim_status. Provide step-by-step. Ask to toggle airplane mode off and reseat SIM if needed. Meanwhile, since we can, fetch line info for L1001 to see if line is active, suspension_start_date, roaming status."

Also we can ask them to toggle Wi‑Fi on and try MMS over Wi‑Fi with Wi‑Fi Calling off, as MMS can work over mobile data or sometimes over Wi‑Fi if the APN provision permits. But given the policy says MMS requires cellular service and mobile data; so focus on cellular. Also we can check messaging app permissions already confirmed. Next step: ask them to toggle network mode preference to 4G/5G preferred if not already, but they already have it. Ask them to toggle airplane mode briefly and try again. Ask them to check for pending carrier settings updates. But that's not allowed to give general procedures not provided.
