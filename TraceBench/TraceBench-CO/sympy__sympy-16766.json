Now I can see the structure. I can see there's a `_print_KroneckerDelta` method near the end of the class. This is a good place to add the `_print_Indexed` method. Let me first create a test script to reproduce the issue, then add the method.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > test_issue.py\nfrom sympy import *\np = IndexedBase(\"p\")\n\nresult = pycode(p[0])\nprint(\"Result:\")\nprint(result)\nEOF\n```\n</output>\n\n<observation>\nSuccessfully created test_issue.py\n\nNow let me run the test to confirm the issue exists.\n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && python test_issue.py\n```\n</output>\n\n<observation>\nResult:\n  # Not supported in Python:\n  # Indexed\np[0]\n\nGreat! I've confirmed the issue. The output shows the warning \"Not supported in Python: Indexed\" as mentioned in the PR description. Now I need to add the `_print_Indexed` method to the PythonCodePrinter class. Let me add it right after the `_print_KroneckerDelta` method.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/def _print_KroneckerDelta(self, expr):/,/return f\"({self._print(expr.args[0])} == {self._print(expr.args[1])})\"/a\\\\n    def _print_Indexed(self, expr):\\\\n        base, *index = expr.args\\\\n        return \"{}[{}]\".format(str(base), \", \".join([self._print(ind) for ind in index]))' /testbed/sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\n</output>\n\n<observation>\nNow let me run the test again to see if the issue is fixed.\n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && python test_issue.py\n```\n</output>\n\n<observation>\nResult:\np[0]\n\nExcellent! The fix works. The warning \"Not supported in Python: Indexed\" is gone and we get the clean output \"p[0]\" as expected. Let me test a few more edge cases to make sure the implementation is robust.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > test_edge_cases.py\nfrom sympy import *\np = IndexedBase(\"p\")\nq = IndexedBase(\"q\")\n\n# Test single index\nprint(\"Single index:\")\nprint(pycode(p[0]))\n\n# Test multiple indices\nprint(\"\\nMultiple indices:\")\nprint(pycode(p[1, 2, 3]))\n\n# Test with symbolic indices\nprint(\"\\nSymbolic indices:\")\ni, j = symbols('i j')\nprint(pycode(p[i, j]))\n\n# Test different bases\nprint(\"\\nDifferent bases:\")\nprint(pycode(q[5]))\nEOF\n```\n</output>\n\n<observation>\nSuccessfully created test_edge_cases.py\n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && python test_edge_cases.py\n```\n</output>\n\n<observation>\nSingle index:\np[0]\n\nMultiple indices:\np[1, 2, 3]\n\nSymbolic indices:\np[i, j]\n\nDifferent bases:\nq[5]\n\nPerfect! All edge cases work correctly. The implementation properly handles:\n1. Single index: `p[0]`\n2. Multiple indices: `p[1, 2, 3]` \n3. Symbolic indices: `p[i, j]`\n4.
