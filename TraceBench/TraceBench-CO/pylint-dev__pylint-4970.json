Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\nCommands must be specified in a single bash code block:\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n</example_response>\n\nExample of an INCORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n\nNow I'll read the file:\n\n```bash\ncat file.txt\n```\n</example_response>\n\nIf you need to run multiple commands, either:\n1. Combine them in one block using && or ||\n```bash\ncommand1 && command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>",

If there are matches, then the match indices in both linesets are stored and associated\nwith the corresponding couples (start line number/end line number) in both files.\nThis association is then postprocessed to handle the case of successive matches. For example if the minimum common lines setting is set to four, then\nthe hashes are computed with four lines. If one of match indices couple (12, 34) is the successor of another one (11, 33) then it means that there are\nin fact five lines wich are common.\nOnce postprocessed the values of association table are the result looked for, i.e start and end lines numbers of common lines in both files.\n\"\"\"\nimport copy\nimport functools\nimport itertools\nimport operator\nimport re\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom getopt import getopt\nfrom itertools import chain, groupby\nfrom typing import (\n    Any,\n    Dict,\n    FrozenSet,\n    Generator,\n    Iterable,\n    List,\n    NamedTuple,\n    NewType,\n    Set,\n    TextIO,\n    Tuple,\n)\n\nimport astroid\nfrom astroid import nodes\n\nfrom pylint.checkers import BaseChecker, MapReduceMixin, table_lines_from_stats\nfrom pylint.interfaces import IRawChecker\nfrom pylint.reporters.ureports.nodes import Table\nfrom pylint.utils import decoding_stream\n\nDEFAULT_MIN_SIMILARITY_LINE = 4\n\nREGEX_FOR_LINES_WITH_CONTENT = re.compile(r\".*\\w+\")\n\n# Index defines a location in a LineSet stripped lines collection\nIndex = NewType(\"Index\", int)\n\n# LineNumber defines a location in a LinesSet real lines collection (the whole file lines)\nLineNumber = NewType(\"LineNumber\", int)\n\n\n# LineSpecifs holds characteristics of a line in a file\nclass LineSpecifs(NamedTuple):\n    line_number: LineNumber\n    text: str\n\n\n# Links LinesChunk object to the starting indices (in lineset's stripped lines)\n# of the different chunk of lines that are used to compute the hash\nHashToIndex_T = Dict[\"LinesChunk\", List[Index]]\n\n# Links index in the lineset's stripped lines to the real lines in the file\nIndexToLines_T = Dict[Index, \"SuccessiveLinesLimits\"]\n\n\nclass CplSuccessiveLinesLimits:\n    \"\"\"\n    This class holds a couple of SuccessiveLinesLimits objects, one for each file compared,\n    and a counter on the number of common lines between both stripped lines collections extracted\n    from both files\n    \"\"\"\n\n    __slots__ = (\"first_file\", \"second_file\", \"effective_cmn_lines_nb\")\n\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        first_file: \"SuccessiveLinesLimits\",\n        second_file: \"SuccessiveLinesLimits\",\n        effective_cmn_lines_nb: int,\n    ) -> None:\n        self.first_file = first_file\n        self.second_file = second_file\n        self.effective_cmn_lines_nb = effective_cmn_lines_nb\n\n\n# Links the in\n</output_head>\n<elided_chars>\n24210 characters elided\n</elided_chars>\n<output_tail>\nnfig.ignore_docstrings,\n            ignore_imports=self.config.ignore_imports,\n            ignore_signatures=self.config.ignore_signatures,\n        )\n        self.stats = None\n\n    def set_option(self, optname, value, action=None, optdict=None):\n        \"\"\"method called to set an option (registered in the options list)\n\n        Overridden to report options setting to Similar\n        \"\"\"\n        BaseChecker.set_option(self, optname, value, action, optdict)\n        if optname == \"min-similarity-lines\":\n            self.min_lines = self.config.min_similarity_lines\n        elif optname == \"ignore-comments\":\n            self.ignore_comments = self.config.ignore_comments\n        elif optname == \"ignore-docstrings\":\n            self.ignore_docstrings = self.config.ignore_docstrings\n        elif optname == \"ignore-imports\":\n            self.ignore_imports = self.config.ignore_imports\n        elif optname == \"ignore-signatures\":\n            self.ignore_signatures = self.config.ignore_signatures\n\n    def open(self):\n        \"\"\"init the checkers: reset linesets and statistics information\"\"\"\n        self.linesets = []\n        self.stats = self.linter.add_stats(\n            nb_duplicated_lines=0, percent_duplicated_lines=0\n        )\n\n    def process_module(self, node):\n        \"\"\"process a module\n\n        the module's content is accessible via the stream object\n\n        stream must implement the readlines method\n        \"\"\"\n        with node.stream() as stream:\n            self.append_stream(self.linter.current_name, stream, node.file_encoding)\n\n    def close(self):\n        \"\"\"compute and display similarities on closing (i.e. end of parsing)\"\"\"\n        total = sum(len(lineset) for lineset in self.linesets)\n        duplicated = 0\n        stats = self.stats\n        for num, couples in self._compute_sims():\n            msg = []\n            lineset = start_line = end_line = None\n            for lineset, start_line, end_line in couples:\n                msg.append(f\"=={lineset.name}:[{start_line}:{end_line}]\")\n            msg.sort()\n\n            if lineset:\n                for line in lineset.real_lines[start_line:end_line]:\n                    msg.append(line.rstrip())\n\n            self.add_message(\"R0801\", args=(len(couples), \"\\n\".join(msg)))\n            duplicated += num * (len(couples) -

If one of match indices couple (12, 34) is the successor of another one (11, 33) then it means that there are\n+in fact five lines wich are common.\n+Once postprocessed the values of association table
