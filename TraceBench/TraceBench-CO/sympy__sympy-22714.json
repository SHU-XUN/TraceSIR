The main source code is in the `sympy` directory. Based on the error traceback, the issue is in `/sympy/geometry/point.py` at line 153 where it raises \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.\" and line 912 where `Point2D` calls `Point(*args, **kwargs)`. Let me first reproduce the issue to understand it better.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce_issue.py\nimport sympy as sp\n\nprint(\"Testing without evaluate(False):\")\ntry:\n    result = sp.S('Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))')\n    print(f\"Success: {result}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTesting with evaluate=False parameter:\")\ntry:\n    result = sp.S('Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))', evaluate=False)\n    print(f\"Success: {result}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTesting with evaluate(False) context:\")\ntry:\n    with sp.evaluate(False):\n        result = sp.S('Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))')\n        print(f\"Success: {result}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\nEOF\n```\n</response>",
